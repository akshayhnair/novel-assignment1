Domestic violence is another cause of homelessness. This issue involves
occasions where children, women, and sometimes men, are physically, mentally, and/or
emotionally abused. Families where the parents fight, on many occasions, results in
their children becoming homeless (Friedman and Danny pp. 19). This violence may be
due to several reasons, but still, results in homelessness. Another cause of
homelessness is mental illness and/or substance abuse. According to statistics carried
out in the US, it was found that this factor is found in 8% of all homeless cases. Youth
and children around the age of 15 are most affected by substance abuse. Mental illness
does not choose on age, but it may be due to biological factors or social factors (Shinn
and Marybeth pp.20-22). In certain cases, family members will reject the substance
abuser, while in other cases an abuser might run from their home and become
voluntarily homeless.
