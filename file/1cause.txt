Homelessness is described as not having a permanent place or home to reside
in. A homeless personâ€™s home is therefore either in shelters or in the streets. There are
several reasons why people become (or choose to be) homeless, and the accumulation
of factors that lead to it vary for each individual. Homelessness does not care whether a
person is young, has a family, is male or female, or are single adults. Some of the most
prominent factors that lead to homelessness are as listed: personal choice, poverty,
substance abuse, domestic violence, limited assistance services, unemployment, and
limited support services. The effects of homelessness also vary and are felt differently
among the homeless, communities, and business communities (Friedman and Danny
pp. 19). Effects of being homeless are: personal, health, abuse, familial, and societal.
Despite having plenty of reasons why people become homeless and why it has different
effects on them, we will only touch upon a few common ones.
