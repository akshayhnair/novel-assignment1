Poverty is one of the biggest factors for causing homelessness. Poverty is whena person lacks the wealth or resources to maintain a proper standard of living.
Occasionally, where someone has nothing to count on for income, they are forced to choose their priorities. Should they choose: transport, childcare, food, healthcare, or
housing—which one should come first? According to a survey conducted in the US,many homeless people are usually employed; however, wages are not always enough
to ensure their housing stability (Shinn and Marybeth pp.20-22). Many of these employed individuals were found not to have jobs that provide high job security and
proper living wages. And of course, unemployment is also a major cause of people becoming homeless. When people lose their jobs or fail to find one within a reasonable
amount of time, in many cases, they will not be able to rent or mortgage a place for living and will be forced to look for shelter elsewhere. In such cases, homelessness can
be a friend staying at another friend’s place, or, as implied with homelessness, staying on the street.
